### <span style="color:orange">Rotational Solids</span>
- After rotating a curve, the solid that is created is no longer of one radius
- The radius of a rotated object is non-constant unless the rotated curve is either completely horizontal or completely vertical

****
### <span style="color:orange">Physical Applications</span>
- Work formula $$\text{Work} = \text{Force} \cdot \text{Distance}$$
- Force is a push or pull applied to a certain object
- Distance is represented by $d$ and is the amount of space between an object's initial position and the objects final position
- The simple (more mathematical) version of the work formula is $w=f \cdot d$
- We want to see how we can perform the above calculation with either $f$ or $d$ changing
- When does the $f$ change
	- Spring problems: Hooke's Law ($f=k \cdot x$) where the force changes based on how far you pull or compress the spring
- In order to solve such problems, we will need to use the integral

****
### <span style="color:orange">Spring Problems</span>
- These questions will likely not be on any of the tests
- You have to use the integral whenever you are working with spring problems where the spring is compressing or decompressing
- The change in length for chain problems may not be apparent

****
### <span style="color:orange">Complications with Chain Problems</span>
- Lifting a $5$ foot chain is not exactly half of the work necessary to lift a $10$ foot chain
