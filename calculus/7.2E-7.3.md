### <span style="color:orange">Review of the Disk/Washer Method</span>
- Disk Method involves "slicing" a 3-dimensional object into disks or very low-height cylinders
- Washer method has $R$ as the larger radius and $r$ as the smaller (inner) radius
	- $R$ will be the distance from the "far" side of the rectangle to the axis of symmetry
	- $r$ will similarly be the distance from the nearer side of the rectangle to the axis of symmetry
- Disk method is the washer method except $r$ is classified as $0$, meaning that one side of the rectangle is touching the axis of symmetry
- You can find the "far" side of a specific washer-method solve by drawing out the situation and then deciding

### <span style="color:orange">Washer Method Techniques</span>
- It is important that the rectangles that we find the area of are perpendicular to the axis of rotation
- If the axis of rotation is the $y$ axis, then we must represent the integrals with $dy$
- By drawing the rectangle, you can find which line the rectangle "bumps" into first, thus helping you determine which is $R$ and which is $r$

### <span style="color:orange">Various Types of Cross-Sections</span>
- In the past, most of the cross-sections were related to circles
- Other shapes can be cross-sections as well, such as triangles, rectangles, etc.
- If the triangle or other non-circular object is extruded, it will create a 3-dimensional object
- Recall the triangle area formula: $$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot h$$
- <mark>Remember the $30-60-90$ triangle ratios!</mark>
- Sometimes, it is acceptable to work on a problem via geometric analysis without using any integrals (only if you know the formula)

### <span style="color:orange">Introduction to the Shell Method</span>
- Does the same thing as the disk and washer method, except the rectangles are now parallel to the axis of rotation
- A "shell" is basically a hollow cylinder
- "Unrolling" a shell is not completely correct because the inside radius is technically smaller than the outer radius
- It is possible to solve all problems that are solved via the shell method using the disk or washer methods, but it may be easier to think of it in the shell-method way
