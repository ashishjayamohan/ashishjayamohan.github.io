<cite>Ashish J.</cite>
## Review for Midterm
- Review will be on Thursday (March 11)
- You can find what is on the midterm in the `Announcements` tab on Canvas
- There are two sections to the midterm and one has set time limits and the other one is self-proctored
- Midterm only accepts PDF's for solutions, so submit your pictures or your solutions via this format
	- More info on this can be found in the `Modules` tab on Canvas
- There is a practice online part in the `Quizzes` tab in Canvas
- There is also a practice take-home part in the `Files` tab in Canvas
- There will be no class on the day of the midterm

## Trigonometric Substitution
- **Main Idea:** Doing a $U$-Substitution backwards
- You use this technique when you have checked that all the other techniques do not work and the integral contains one of the following terms:
	- $\sqrt{a^2 - u^2}$
	- $\sqrt{a^2 + u^2}$
	- $\sqrt{u^2 - a^2}$
- We consider the above formulae as triangles and we consider what we are solving for using the Pythagorean theorem
- Translated formulae using $\theta$
	- $\sqrt{a^2 - u^2} \rightarrow a \cdot \sin (\theta)$
	- $\sqrt{a^2 + u^2} \rightarrow a \cdot \tan (\theta)$
	- $\sqrt{u^2 - a^2} \rightarrow a \cdot \cos (\theta)$

## Other Things to Consider
- Definite integrals
- Examples with 3rd triangle
- Looking at ranges of $\theta$
