## <span style="color:cyan">Lesson 5.8 - February 1, 2021</span>
### <span style="color:orange">General Overview</span>
- More rules and techniques to compute integrals
- Applications of the antiderivative or Integral
- Look at series and rules for when they converge and diverge
- Applications and extensions of series (Taylor series, etc.)
- Infinite Polynomials
****
### <span style="color:orange">Topics to Review</span>
- Integral rules
	- Antiderivative "version" of the power rule
	- U-Substitution (Reverse of the Chain Rule)
- Difference between definite and indefinite integrals
- What is a definite integral actually calculating? (Also, how does it calculate that)
- The connection between definite and indefinite integrals
****
### <span style="color:orange">Basic Application</span>
- $\int_{0}^{3} (4-x^2) \,dx$ is a numerical value, not a function
- This number will be the area under the curve that is shown when the function is graphed
- The area under the curve is found by taking the sum of numerous rectangles (approaching infinity) that are fitted under the curve
- As the number of rectangles increases, the width of each individual rectangle decreases and approaches $0$
****
### <span style="color:orange">Rule Convention</span>
- Each previous derivative rule gives a corresponding antiderivative rule
- Insert chart with integral/deriv of sin(x)
- $\int sec^2(x) \,dx = tan(x)$
- **U-Substitution: ** The "U" is the function that is "inside" or is inside the parenthesis, in the denominator, in the exponent...

### <span style="color:orange">Writing Antiderivative Rules</span>
- **Main Goal: **Use our previous derivative rules to write new antiderivative rules
- Example of several derivatives which we can use to write antiderivative rules:![[Screen Shot 2021-02-02 at 11.03.04 AM.png]]
- By knowing these derivatives, we can conclusively say that the integral of the derivatives of these functions will be the functions themselves
- In essence, $\int f'(x) \,dx = f(x)$
****
### <span style="color:orange">Combination of Antiderivative Rules With U-Substitution</span>
- Each derivative rule has a chain rule version
- We can simplify each derivative into some form of the chain rule, allowing us to also write all antiderivative rule as some form of U-Substitution
- Short example of process specified above:![[Screen Shot 2021-02-02 at 11.29.23 AM.png]]
- In certain U-Substitution, you may find that you get $u' \cdot dx = \frac{du}{dx} \cdot dx = du$
- **Note:** Always make sure to include $+ \,C$ at the end of the product of an integral
- Finding a pattern in U-Substitution/Chain Rule can help you find a quick and easy solution to a problem even when the numerical values and formulae may be more complex
- Having a general antiderivative rule with some aspects of U-Substitution helps achieve previously stated goal
- Simple example problem with $arcsin$ derivative: ![[Screen Shot 2021-02-02 at 11.44.29 AM.png]]

### <span style="color:orange">Inverse Trigonometry Trick vs. U-Substitution</span>
- For U-Substitution, you need to see a function and its derivative in the integrand ($u$ and $du$ in the function)
- Essentially, figure out which values are $u$, $du$, etc. through patter recognition and matching
- This may require some algebraic manipulation (factoring, multiplication, etc.) in order to find correct pattern (may sometimes also require complete the square)
