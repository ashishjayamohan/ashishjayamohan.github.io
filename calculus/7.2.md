### <span style="color:orange">Disk Method</span>
- Using the definite integral to calculate the volume of a surface of revolution
- For comparison
	- Area is for 2-dimensional objects and is represented as $\text{cm}^2$ or $\text{in}^2$
	- Volume is for 3-dimensional objects and is represented as $\text{cm}^3$ or $\text{in}^3$
- Surface area - if you wanted to wrap a specific object with wrapping paper, this would be the area covered by the paper
- This "Disk Method" can only be used to find the volume of certain types of surfaces and objects (Surfaces of Revolution)

### <span style="color:orange">Surfaces of Revolution</span>
- Starting with a specific curve, the curve can be spun around an axis
- The axis can be any line, but it is easier with the $x$ and $y$ axes
- As each point revolves around the axis, the point will trace the path of a circle
- Example of above process: ![[Screen Shot 2021-02-09 at 10.21.06 AM.png]]
- **What calculation are we actually doing?**
	- If this bowl that we drew out was filled with water or some fluid, how much water would actually be filled in that bowl?
	- We are finding the volume of these 3-dimensional shapes

### <span style="color:orange">Calculating Volume of Rotated Solids</span>
- We first have to calculate the integral of our curve
	- The integral is the sum of many rectangles that are fitted underneath the curve
	- As the number of rectangles increases, the rectangles become smaller and the total area gets closer to the actual area under the curve
- "Slicing" a 3-dimensional rotationally obtained object will produce a number of circles with a slight thickness
	- These circles are called disks
	- Disks are CD's with no holes in the middle
- For reference, look at *Figure 7.14* in the textbook
- Each cross-section of the rotated object will not be a perfect fit, but we can use limits to try and mitigate this error
- As the number of disks increases, the height of each disk decreases and the calculated volume gets closer to the actual volume
- Volume of each disk can be calculated as a cylinder $$\text{Volume} = \pi \cdot r^2 \cdot h$$
- The height of each disk will be $dx$
- The radius of each disk will be $f(x)$, with the diameter being $2 \cdot f(x)$
- Thus, the volume of each disk will be $$\text{Volume} = \pi \cdot f(x)^2 \cdot dx$$
	- $dx$ can be represented as $\Delta x$
- By calculation and the addition of the integral, we find that the volume of the entire solid must be as follows: $$\pi \cdot \int_{a}^{b} (f(x))^2\,dx$$
- Simply said, we are approximating the area under the curve  using an infinite number of simple shapes
- Eventually, the height of each of the disks gets to $0$ with our limits
- Same idea could be applied to functions in the form $f(y)$
****
### <span style="color:orange">Special Notes</span>
- There are "disks," "washers," and "shells"
	- Disks have been described previously (basically a cylinder with a very small height)
	- Washers are basically a CD (with the hole in the middle)
	- Shells are where it's just the siding
- Think about what each slice looks like and in what orientation you will solve the problem before attempting any manipulation
- In certain problems, you may be asked to compute the numerical value of the volume, but in other cases, you will just be asked to compute the formula (integral)
****
### <span style="color:orange">Techniques</span>
- Draw a sample rectangle and find, when rotated, what shape the rotated figure takes on
- The above method can also help you determine whether a problem is to be solved as a function of $y$ or as a function of $x$
- In certain cases, you might need to find the area between two curves in order to find a specific volume, where one function is $f(x)$ and the other is $g(x)$
- With washers, the volume can be found via $$\pi \cdot (R^2 - r^2) \cdot h$$
- $R$ will be the distance from the axis of revolution to the farther curve while $r$ will be the distance from the axis of revolution to the closer curve
