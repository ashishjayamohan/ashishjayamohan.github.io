### <span style="color:orange">Completing the Square</span>
- Figure out what `+ C` is necessary in order to factor a certain epression into a perfect square
- Be careful not to change the problem while completing the square
- $U$ will always be the variable piece whilst $a$ will always be the numerical piece
- Try U-Substitution before trying out one of the tricks

### <span style="color:orange">7.1 Introduction</span>
- **Main point of unit**: Applications of the Integral, specifically what we can use definite integrals for
- Important review:![[Screen Shot 2021-02-04 at 10.42.07 AM.png]]
- Support for above formulae is given by the fundamental theorem of calculus
- Definite integral calculates the area under a curve between two given numbers, $a$ and $b$
- The definite integral is the sum of numerous rectangles placed underneath a specific curve that we are observing
- As the limit of number of rectangle approaches infinity, the width of each rectangle approaches $0$. As this happens, the height of each rectangle stays at $f(x)$, width appraches $0$, but the total area of the rectangles stay roughly the same
- Note: $\text{Area of rectangle} = \text{width} \cdot \text{height}$

### <span style="color:orange">Area Between Two Curves</span>
- You can find the area between two curves by taking the integral from $a$ to $b$ of the top curve, taking the integral of the bottom curve from $a$ to $b$, and subtracting the integral of the bottom curve from the integral of the top curve
- This difference of integrals can be written as a singular integral
- $$\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx \,- \int_{a}^{b}g(x)\,dx = \int_{a}^{b}f(x)-g(x)\,dx$$
- In this difference of integrals, the height of the rectangles tha we are measuring will be $f(x)-g(x)$, where $f(x)$ is the top curve and $g(x)$ is the bottom curve

### <span style="color:orange">Useful Techniques</span>
- Draw out the situation's graph just to visualize what the limits represent
- In such a situation, it would also be advised to draw out the rectangles that we are trying to find the area of
- Oftentimes, we will need to use algebra to solve intermediate steps before we get to a clean path to the solution
- The "top" curve will be the one with generically higher function values for a defined section of the graph
****
### <span style="color:orange">Special Situations</span>
- "Top" function may change in different sections of a graph
- If both the functions are continuous and there are no points of intersection in the specified range, the "top" function will always be the "top" function
- Depending on the wording of a certain problem, you may or may not need to completely solve out the integral
- In certain functions, it may be necessary to use $dy$ instead of $dx$ because the function may be of $y$ (like $f(y)$ or $g(y)$)
- In cases where you are given a function of $y$, it may be worthwhile to convert it to a function of $x$
