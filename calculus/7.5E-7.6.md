### <span style="color:orange">7.5 Review</span>
- We are examining the work formula, which is detailed as such: $$W = F \cdot D$$
- We can never have negative work as work always has to be a positive quantity
- The weight of a slice is the volume of the slice multiplied by the slice's density
- $$\text{Volume} = \text{Weight} \cdot \text{Density}$$ $$v = w \cdot \delta$$ $$v = m \cdot g \cdot \delta$$
- Recall the equation of a circle centered at $(h,k)$: $$(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$$
- Using the above equation, we can solve for $r$ or for any other value that we don't know using the constants that we **do** know

### <span style="color:orange">Center of Mass</span>
- Various Cases
	- Points in Space
		- 1-Dimensional Cases
		- 2-Dimensional Cases
		- We can also consider problems in any $n$-dimensional space
	- 2-Dimensional Regions of Constant Density
- Center of mass is about finding the balance point or finding the fulcrum in an uneven torque situation
- How to find the balance point
	- Think about it as a weighted average
	- If you solve using torque, you can find the balance point by finding the point where the torque on both sides of the fulcrum are equivalent
	- For reminder: $$\text{Torque} = \text{Force} \cdot \text{Distance from Fulcrum}$$ $$\tau = F \cdot d$$
	- Note that the weight of a particular point will differ from it's $x$ or $y$ position
	- Final Formula: $$\dfrac{x_1 \cdot m_1 + x_2 \cdot m_2 + \dots + x_k \cdot m_k}{m_1+m_2+\dots+m_k}$$ $$\dfrac{\sum x_i\cdot m_i}{\sum m_i}$$

### <span style="color:orange">Center of Mass in Multiple Dimensions</span>
- In two dimensions, we use the same formula as above, except we apply the formula in both the $x$ and $y$ directions
- The same formula applies in the $3$-dimensional situations as well, applying the same formula in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes
- Using this formula in multiple dimensions, we can find the area of sections between two curves
- The mid point of a rectangle between two curves will be: $$\dfrac{f(x) + g(x)}{2}$$
- In a rectangle with theoretical width of $0$, the centroid of the rectangle will be: $$(x,\dfrac{f(x)+g(x)}{2})$$

### <span style="color:orange">Center of Mass with Constant Density</span>
- Imagine cutting a piece of foam and finding the point on that solid where you put your finger so as to balance that piece of foam perfectly
- The mass of a certain rectangle will be directly proportional to the area of the rectangle (*Assumes Constant Density*)
- For rectangles, we can assume that all the mass is concentrated at the center of mass, then continue to solve the problem as a point problem in two dimensions
- The center of mass formula for $2$ dimensions is: $$(\dfrac{x_1 \cdot m_1 + x_2 \cdot m_2 + \dots + x_k \cdot m_k}{m_1+m_2+\dots+m_k},\dfrac{y_1 \cdot m_1 + y_2 \cdot m_2 + \dots + y_k \cdot m_k}{m_1+m_2+\dots+m_k})$$ $$(\dfrac{\sum x_i\cdot m_i}{\sum m_i},\dfrac{\sum y_i\cdot m_i}{\sum m_i})$$
- The x-coordinate of the rectangle when it becomes infinitely small is $dx$
- $$\text{Center of Mass} \rightarrow \text{COM}$$
- If you notice some symmetry, then you can skip certain steps that you may not need as doing the calculation will lead you to the same result
	- For example:![[Screen Shot 2021-02-23 at 11.54.31 AM.png]]
	- This perfect curve would **need** to have its centroid at the $x$ coordinate at position $0$
	- Thus, we can skip trying to find the average of the $x$ coordinates to find the centroid's $x$ coordinate because we can visually see this fact
- If the shape is a perfect circle, then you can find the centroid visually

### <span style="color:orange">Applications of the Centroid</span>
- You can use the centroid to calculate the volume of a given solid
- Particularly, you can use this when calculating the volumes of tauruses (Donut shapes)
- Tauruses are produced when rotating a circle around a central axis
