### 6.2 Extension
- Application: find an orthagonal family or curves
- Family where every curve is perpendicular to every other curve
- How can you tell if two lines are perpendicular? How can you tell by their slopes?
- Their slopes will always be negative reciprocals of each other if the two lines are negative
- $$s_1 = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot s_2$$
- What does it means for lines to be orthagonal?
	- Derivatives of the curves are negative reciprocals
- **Example:** $y=\frac{C}{x}$
	- Start with $$C=x \cdot y$$
	- Using implicit differentiation, $$\frac{d}{dx}(C) = \frac{d}{dx}(x \cdot y)$$
	- $$0 = y + x \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}$$
	- $$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-y}{x}$$
	- $$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{x}{y}$$
	- $$y \cdot dy = x \cdot dx$$

## Logistic Differential Equation
- More accurate version of exponential growth at the expense of simplicity
- Recall the exponential growth model ($\frac{dy}{dt} = k \cdot y$)
- $$y = C \cdot e^{k \cdot t}$$
- Note that as $t$ tends towards $\infty$, $y$ will also teend towards $\infty$
- $L$ is the carrying capacity of the environment (where the relationship breaks off and levels)
- We get the formula $$\frac{dy}{dt} = k \cdot y \cdot (1 - \frac{y}{L})$$
- Assume the $k$ and $L$ are greater than $0$
- If $y > L$, the population is decreasing (you can find this by looking at the sign of $1-\frac{y}{L}$)
- If $y < L$, the population is growing, but will stop at $L$

## Other Integration Tricks
- Add or subtract the same expression
- Trig Identities and Substitutions
- Multiplying or dividing by conjugates
- Expand polynomials
	-Rewrite fractions using long division or rewriting as a sum
- Complete the square
- Adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing by the same term can also help

## Product Rule for Integration
- Idea is to integrate the product of two functions
- You have to choose what those two functions are (similar to $U$-substitution)
- **Example:** $$\int x \cdot \sin(x) \, dx$$
- We make $x$ into its derivative and find the antiderivative of $\sin(x)$
- We end up with $$\int 1 \cdot (-\cos(x))$$

> ### **Main Rule of Integration By Parts** $$\int u \, dv = u \cdot v - \int vr \, du$$

## How to Choose Which Function is U
- `LIATE` is an acronym you can use to quickly identify this pattern
- The following values are in order from first priority to lowest priority
- Logarithms
- Inverse
- Algebraic
- Trigonometry
- Exponents
