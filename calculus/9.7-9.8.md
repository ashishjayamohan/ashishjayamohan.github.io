# Lesson 9.7 & 9.8 - April 22, 2021
## Power Series
- Idea is a series with form: $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n x^n = a_0 + a_1 x^1 + a_2 x^2 + \ldots$$
- Sets of inputs is the domain while the set of outputs is the range of the series
- How can we use a power series to define a function?
- Once you plug in a number of $x$ in $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}$, the infinite polynomial turns into an infinite series
- How can we tell if this infinite series converges or not?
- We use the ratio test to find the ratio between consecutive terms

- If a series is absolutely convergent, then it is also conditionally convergent
