### <span style="color:orange">Differential Equations</span>
- What is a differential equation?
- What is a solution of a differential equation
- How do you find the solution to a differential equation
- Recall what are algebraic equations
	- $$3x+5 - 7x-2$$ $$x^@+5x+6=0$$ $$x^2 + 7x+12=0$$
	- There is an unknown number $x$ that we are given some algebraic properties about
	- You have a solution when you can plug in your number for $x$ and successfully solve the situation
	- There are certain solutions that may bee incorrect, so checking them is necessary
- We are given information about the derivative of the unknown function $y$ and our goal is to figure out what thee function is
- **Example:** $\frac{dy}{dx} = 5x$ vs. $\frac{dy}{dx} = 5y$
- Recall that $y$ is a function of $x$ where $x$ is a variable value

### <span style="color:orange">Form 1 Solutions</span>
- Solutions to differential equations where the function is in the form $\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x)$
- You can solve these by taking the antiderivative or by taking the integral of the function
- **Example:** $\frac{dy}{dx} = 5x$, thus $y=\frac{5x^2}{2} + C$
- >Remember to include the constant of integration ($C$) at the end of your integration expression to account for your $y$-intercept

### <span style="color:orange">Form 2 Solutions</span>
- When you have problems in the form $\frac{dy}{dx} = g(y)$, you need to recall the base case
- Base case is $\frac{dy}{dx} = y$, where $y=e^x$
- Recall the constant or integration in this case will cause the final solution to be $y=C \cdot e^x$
- **Example:** $\frac{dy}{dx} = 5y$, thus $y=5\cdot e^{5x}$
- We can also have problems like $y''-5y'+6y=0$

### <span style="color:orange">Applications of Differential Equations</span>
- Why are we interested in differential equations? What kind of problems do they help us solve?
- You may only have information about how fast a quantity is changing, not any specific values about the dataset
- This topic is covered in MAT4B which is completely based on this topic
- What is our method for solving differential equations?
	- Called 'Separation of Variables'
	- Only works if the differential equation is separable

### <span style="color:orange">Separation of Variables Methodology</span>
- Introduction to the Method
	- For an **example**, we will follow the flow of the following equation: $y'=\frac{2x}{y}$
	- Move everything with $x$ to one side and move everything with $y$ to the other side, primarily using multiplication and division ($\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{2x}{y}$)
	- We want both $dy$ and $dx$ to be in the numerators, treating $\frac{dy}{dx}$ as a proper fraction ($y \cdot dy = 2x \cdot dx$)
	- Put the integral sign on both sides of the equation ($\int y \cdot dy = \int 2x \cdot dx$)
	- Compute the integrals placed in the last step ($\frac{y^2}{2} = x^2 + C$)
		- *Remember to put the constant of integration on one side of the equation!*
	- Answer ($y=\pm \sqrt{2x^2+C}$)
- Looking into functionality of the method
	- Utilizing U-Substitution where $U=y$
		- **Example:** $\int u \,du = \int 2x \, dx$
	- >If there are complex numbers, the solution will typically be very simple, but if the problem contains very simple numbers, the solution will typically be quite complex
	- In a problem where you are given a formula by form: $y=C\cdot e^{k\cdot t}$, note that this situation will often be easily solvable by using $C$ as the initial 'population', $t$ as the number of iterations, and $k$ as the growth rate per iteration

### <span style="color:orange">Cooling Curves</span>
- Newton's Law of Cooling: The rate at which an object cools is proportional to the difference between the temperature of the object and the room temperature or the temperature of the surrounding medium
- Mathematically, this is represented like $\frac{dy}{dt} = k \cdot (y-T_m)$
- This prior equation leads us to $\ln |y-T_m| = K \cdot t + C$
- Note that $T_m$ is the room temperature
