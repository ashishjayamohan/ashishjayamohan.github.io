# Lesson 9.5 - April 20, 2021
## Alternating Series Test
- $\sum (-1)^n \cdot a_n$ or $\sum (-1)^{n+1} \cdot a_n$
- Convergence occurs if $a$ is eventually nonincreasing or when $\lim_{x \to \infty} = 0$
- A sequence converges if it is bounded and monotonic (decreasing and bounded below, or increasing and bounded above)

## Notation
- Absolute convergence is where $\sum |a_n|$ converges
- If a series is absolutely convergent, then it is most assuredly convergent because absolute convergence is a tighter set of requirements than convergence alone
- Note the difference between absolute and conditional convergence
- **Example problems:**
	- $$\sum \dfrac{(-1)^n}{n^2}$$
	- $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{-1}{n^2}$$

## Applications
- Why do we care about classifying a series as absolute or conditionally convergent
- Sum of series convergences
	- If $\sum a_n \rightarrow A$ and $\sum b_n \rightarrow B$, then $\sum a_n + b+n \rightarrow A+B$
- **Example Problem**: Does $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{\sin(n)}{n^2}$
	- $\sin$ can be negative, so the system can be negative
	- If the series has negative terms, make sure to check if the series is alternating
