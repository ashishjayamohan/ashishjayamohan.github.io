### <span style="color:orange">Finding Region Boundaries</span>
- The bounded region in a given problem always has to be bounded on all sides
- Essentially, the bounded region cannot be of infinite size and must have a numerical area, thus causing the resultant revolved solid to have a finite volume as well
- If there are two regions that fit the above criteria, the problem will usually mention which area to pay attention to, but the region being adressed in the problem is the area bounded by **all** of the given boundary lines

### <span style="color:orange">Arc Length</span>
- Previously, we were calculating the volume of solids of revolution
- Now, we're calculating arc lengths and surface areas of revolved solids
- Arc length is essentially taking a curve (piece of sting), laying it out straight, and measuring the length of the final straightened string
- Surface Area vs. Volume
	- Surface area is the amount of paper you would need in order to wrap a certain solid with wrapping paper
	- Volume is the amount of water that would be needed to "fill" the solid
- Volume is measured in $\text{Units}^3$ while surface area is measured in $\text{Units}^2$

### <span style="color:orange">Mean Value Theorem</span>
- Recall the MVT is only applicable when the function is continuous and meets several other criteria
- There exists a point $c$ between $a$ and $b$ where the derivative at point $c$ is the average rate of change of the function from $a$ to $b$
- You cannot simply use rectangles' horizontal aspect to solve these problems
- The average rate of change between $a$ and $b$ can be found through $\text{Slope} = f'(x) \cdot dx$, where $dx = |a-b|$
- Through this, we derive the following formula![[Screen Shot 2021-02-16 at 11.39.28 AM.png]]

### <span style="color:orange">Formula's Details</span>
- In certain cases, you can neglect the $\pm$ in the square root because you may know that the function is only being analyzed in a positive or negative setting
- You can adapt the formula to your setting, knowing that certain cases are accounted for previously

### <span style="color:orange">Rotating Specification</span>
- Rotating a specific piece from a curve will create a cone-like shape
- This piece will be like a shell, but will have some kind of "degree" to it
- The surface area of a specific cross-section of the final rotated solid will be the length of the snippet's curve, as rotated around the central axis
- The length of the "unrolled" shell will be the circumference of the rotated solid's cross-section
- Finally, we get out formula:![[Screen Shot 2021-02-16 at 12.11.04 PM.png]]
