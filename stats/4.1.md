# Lesson 4.2 - February 25, 2021
****
## Review
- The closer that a set of points are to being a straight line, the closer the correlation coefficient is to $1$ and $-1$
- If the data points are in an exactly straight line, the correlation coefficient will be either $1$ or $-1$
- Certain plots will have no pattern and the correlation coefficient will be exactly $0$
- Describing relationships and trends using the trend, shape, and strength

## Correlation Coefficient Calculation
- >$$r = \sum \dfrac{Z_x \cdot Z_y}{n-1}$$
- There are two variables: $(x,y)$
- For instance, $x$ could be height while $y$ could be weight
- $Z_x = \dfrac{x-\bar{x}}{s_x}$, where $\bar{x}$ refers to the mean of the $x$ values
- Ultimately, the formula for the $Z$-score is generalized as $Z_n = \dfrac{n-\bar{n}}{s_n}$ where $n$ is some arbitrary set of numbers
- You have to calculate the individual $Z$-score for each one of the values in the data set
- Unfortunately, this calculation is very tedious, thus this is not usually done by hand unless the dataset happens to be within reasonable limits

****
## Correlations
- >The number that you get from your correlation coefficient calculation determines how "strong" the correlation is between the two variables that you are measuring
- When is the product of the two $Z$-scores positive?
	- When both values are positive
	- When both values are negative
- Positive correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable seems to increase as well ($y=x$)
- The $Z$-score is negative when the two values have opposite signs
- Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases ($y=-x$)
- No correlation means that as one variable increases, it has no effect on the value of the other variable ($y=0$ or $y=n$ where $n$ is any constant)

## Modelling Linear Trends
- We can use the best fit line to make predictions from the data that we've been given
- Given a value for one variable, you can predict the value of the other variable using the best fit line
- It is often easier to use $x$ and $y$ as these are included naturally in the cartesian plane, so it can be easier to follow trends and understand how this relationship looks
- Given a value for $y$, you can solve for $x$
- Unless the correlation coefficient is $1$ or $-1$ (indicating a perfect correlation), your prediction is going to be slightly off from the real answer
- A sample table which could be represented perfectly by a best fit line is shown below:
|Value|Age|
|--|--|
|30,000|0|
|30,000 - 4,000|1|
|30,000 - 8,000|2|
