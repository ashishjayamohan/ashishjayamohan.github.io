### <span style="color:green">1.3 Extension</span>
- If you are not directly assigning groups for control and treatment groups, then it is an observational study
- We collect data about a sample
	- Data can either be categorical or quantitative
	- Categorical data can be numerical, but may be something like a session ID
	- Quantitative data is a numerical value, like how many minutes a person spends on a website
- **StatCrunch:** The built-in data analysis software that can be accessed via the `MyLab and Mastering` tab on Canvas
- It is important to find which questions a dataset can or cannot answer
- Finding patterns help us interpret the world through numbers or through generic ideas

### <span style="color:green">Analyzing Data Using Graphs</span>
- All of these describe the frequency of certain values in a specific data set for each variable
- **Dot Plots**
	- Useful for a smal number of values of categories
	- Can be used for categorical data
	- Example Dot Plot: ![[Screen Shot 2021-02-09 at 1.22.56 PM.png]]
	- When there are too many categories, there would be too many categories and the dot plot would be too wide-spread
	- To solve the above problems, we group similar values together, leading to the histogram
- **Histograms**
	- Useful when there's not a good way to split up the values or there are many possible values in the dataset
	- Groups similar values together, but based off the dot plot
	- Example Histogram: ![[Screen Shot 2021-02-09 at 1.26.11 PM.png]]
	- Dots are replaced with bars with a nicely scales axis for the $y$ axis
	- Idea of "bins" breaks down the data into seperate categories, by which we can graph them
- **Stem and Leaf Plots**
	- Most useful when working by hand
	- Otherwise, is one of the least useful types of graphs
	- Sideways histogram where the bins are chosen for you
	- On the left side of the $y$ axis, put every number except the last digit
	- On the right side of the $y$ axis, put the last digit
	- Example stem and leaf plot:![[Screen Shot 2021-02-09 at 2.01.59 PM.png]]

### <span style="color:green">Statcrunch Specifics</span>
- In Statcrunch, you can graph histograms and other graphs by clicking on `Graph` and going into the sub-menu and clicking on the type of graph you want to make
- When graphing a histogram, you can let Statcrunch automatically create bins and decide their widths and their heights
- Any fields that are marked `--optional--` do not need to be filled out and can be calculated automatically
- If you make a graph, you can adjust the size (width and height) to see what the graph would look like if it was expanded to full length
- Statcrunch will not let you make histograms for categorical data
- Each bin's width represents the range of the variable that we are grouping the data into
****
### <span style="color:green">Graph Patterns</span>
- Skew says which direction the graph's "tail" is "pointed" towards, points to outliers in that direction
- Outliers are data points that are far away from most of the other points
- Sometimes outliers aren't real and could be a mistake
- Think about how much effect you want an outlier to have on the final results of your study
- Symmetric graphs have no skew whatsoever and have the maximum value directly in the middle of the graph
- The peak of the graph represents the most frequently occuring value of the entire set
- In an income graph, a certain extremely rich person (Mark Zuckerberg, for example) could "pull" the graph towards their end of the graph
- Increasing the number of bins and decreasing the width of each bin in a histogram provides a cleaner curve
- A curve is skewed to a direction if there is an outlier in that direction
****
### <span style="color:green">Modal Graphs</span>
- Unimodal means the graph has a singular peak
- Bimodal means the graph has $2$ or more peaks
- Example unimodal/bimodal graph: ![[Screen Shot 2021-02-09 at 2.29.28 PM.png]]
- There is usually an explanation for bimodal graphs; always question why the bimodal graph may have been caused
