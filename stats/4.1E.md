## Best Fit Line
- Idea is the same: we want to find the best fit line in a specific scatter plot to examine the relationship between the two variables plotted on the graph
- Questions to keep in mind
	- When is the best fit line useful?
	- How good is our prediction? How can we measure this accuracy?
	- How is the best fit line constructed?
	- *What can go wrong and affect the accuracy of the best fit line?*
- Our goal for this section is to provide a bit more detail
- Recall what $r$ refers to, the correlation coefficient
	- Given any scatter plot, you can calculate $r$
	- Calculating $r$ by hand is quite complex, so this is a task usually designated to computers
	- Calculated from the $z$-scores for each element of the sample (for both variables)
- When is the best fit line useful?
	- When the data is linear (best way to check is just by looking at the scatter plot and analyzing it as an object)
	- Look at $r^2$ as a percentage (after multiplying by $100$). basically, you can say $(r^2 \cdot 100) \%$ of the variance in the response variable is explained by the independent variable. Essentially, the larger that $r^2$ is, the more linear the relationship is
- Equation for best fit line is not $y=mx+b$, but is $y=a+bx$
- $$a = \bar{y} = b \bar{x}$$
- $$b = r \cdot \frac{s_y}{s_x}$$
- $$y = (r\cdot \frac{ss_y}{s_x}) \cdot x + \bar{y} - (r \cdot \frac{s_y}{s_x}) \cdot \bar{x}$$

## Regression Line
> ### Rule of Thumb
> Don't use regression lines to extrapolate or predict data from your analysis
- You can only use the regression line for values that are within the set of values that you have

## Introduction to Probability Theory
- We normally use data to make a prediction (best fit line), now we work in the opposite direction
- Most common question is about heads/tails and flipping coins
- Each side has an equal chance of coming up (50/50)
- **Sets** contain **elements** which indicate particular outcomes
- **Events** are a subset or subcollection of the elements or outcomes presented in the set
- $P(E)$ represents the probability of the event $E$
- $P(E) = \frac{\text{Size of E}}{\text{Size of Set of Outcomes}}$
- $E^c$ is the event where $E$ does not occur
