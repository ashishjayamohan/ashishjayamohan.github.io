## Review
- $P(E)$ represents the probability of the event $E$
- General rule for $P(E)$: $$P(E) \in [0,1]$$
- $P(E)$ measures how likely an event is to occur with $0$ meaning it is impossible and $1$ meaning it is absolutely guaranteed
- $P(E)$ also gives the structure of area to various events. Probabilities of sets combine and interact in the same ways that the areas of shapes do

## Rules of Probabilities
- **Special case**: if every outcome in the sample space is equally likely, then we can find probability by counting and taking the ratio. Mathematically: $$\frac{\text{Number of Outcomes that Satisfy Condition}}{\text{Total Number of Outcomes}} = P(E)$$
- $$P(E) = \dfrac{\text{Size of } E}{\text{Size of } S}$$

- If you know $P(E)$, you also know $P(E^*)$ as $P(E^*) = 1 - P(E)$
