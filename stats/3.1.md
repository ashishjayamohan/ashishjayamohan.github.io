****
### <span style="color:green">Review</span>
- Review of StatCrunch features and the necessary parameters for graphs
- Recall how to graph categorical data, using stem-and-leaf plots and other types of graphs
- Recall that you can create graphs by clicking through the `Graph` tab on StatCrunch
- You can "restrict" a specific dataset so as to only graph data that is relevant to the question that you desire to answer
- There are several "Select a Graph" questions in the textbook which you can practice on and improve your skills in this regard

### <span style="color:green">Symmetric Distributions</span>
- Standard Deviation tells us about the variance of the dataset, or how spread out the data is
- Mean is the average of the dataset
- Mathematically, the mean refers to the sum of all the numbers, divided by the total number of terms
- The mean could be imagined as the fulcrum of a see-saw, being dynamic based on the relative weights of the objects on either side
- Outliers have a very noticeable effect on the mean of a specific dataset
- In StatCrunch Histograms, you can choose to display the mean in the graph.

### <span style="color:green">Conventions</span>
- The mean of a specific dataset it either represented as $\bar{x}$ or as $\mu$
- The standard deviation of a specific dataset is represented as $S$
- The formal mean formula is: $$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x}{n}$$
- The sample size is usually referred to as $n$
- Standard Deviation is calculated as follows: $$S = \sqrt{\dfrac{\sum (x - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$$

****
### <span style="color:green">Symmetric Distribution Rules</span>
- If the data is unimodal and symmetric, then the following rules apply:
- Approximately 68% of all data points are within 1 standard deviation from the mean value
- Approximately 95% are within 2 standard deviations from the mean value
- Approximately 99.7% (pretty much all of the values) are withing 3 standard deviations from the mean value

****
### <span style="color:green">Standard Deviation</span>
- Standard Deviations give context to the data set and to any given number that we may have from the dataset
- Knowing the mean can only tell you whether you are lower or higher than the average, but not how that delta compares with other people's difference from the mean
- Given a list of test scores and your test score, you can find what a good score is by using standard deviation
- The standard deviation helps you understand a certain number in the context of a dataset
