### <span style="color:green">Graphs of Categorical Data</span>
- Oftentimes, it is not obvious which order or in which list we should graph a specific categorical dataset in
- A Pareto graph is when the data is organized by frequency (biggest to smallest)
- You can use the `Barplot` option in StatCrunch to create graphs that graph by category
- Pareto graphs aren't labeled exactly in StatCrunch, but can be made by making the graph `Value Descending`

### <span style="color:green">Bar Graph Specifics</span>
- Bar graphs are the way that we can visualize categorical data
- For bar graphs, there is no notion of "skew" as there is no way to tell whether a categorical dataset is skewed right or left
- There is still the concept of amount of variation as we can tell whether there is a lot or not that much of variation in a specific dataset via a bar graph
- There are still modes in such datasets and are just the most frequent value
- In categorical graphs, the scale is not the same across various graphs, so be careful when comparing graphs
- Stacked bar graphs is where you put one bar on top of another bar
- Side-by-side is the opposite of stacked data

### <span style="color:green">Interpreting Graphs</span>
- Convention is that each bar graph starts from $0$
- Bar graphs can be misleading because they are sometimes drawn in 3-Dimensions or in odd perspectives, making it harder to compare their relative sizes
