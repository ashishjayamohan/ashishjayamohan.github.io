****
### <span style="color:green">Review</span>
- Yes and No questions will have $0$ associated with "No" and $1$ associated with "Yes" (Binary System)
- Recall the difference between parameters and statistics
- Recall the difference between stacked and unstacked data sets
****
### <span style="color:green">Ways to Organize Categorical Data</span>
- Something to keep in mind: when would you want to modify the counts or the numbers included in the data or change the actual numbers into percentages or proportions
- Relative Frequency can provide key information when studying a specific dataset
****
### <span style="color:green">Mathematical Standards</span>
- When calculating a fraction in statistics, the denominator should always be the total
- A specific percentage will be its respective fraction multiplied by 100
****
### <span style="color:green">Observational Studies vs. Controlled Experiment</span>
- Observational Studies are used to show associations
	- Can be aggected by confounding variables (variables that may affect final results)
- Controlled Experiments are used to prove cause and effects
	- Controlled experiment tries to minimize lurking and confounding variables
- In both, the goal is to find how one variable affects another variable
- For both, you want to split the participants into two groups as evenly as possible (treatment group and control group)
- In an obsevational study, the treatment and control groups are chosen randomly
- In controlled experiments, you can control who is in the treatment and control groups
- In certain cases, it is impossible to turn the event into a controlled experiment (smoker example)
- The two groups in an eperiment should be as similar as possible and the only difference between the people in the two groups should be the treatment variable
- **Confounding Variable:** A variable other than the treatment variable that causes a change in the result
****
### <span style="color:green">Controlled Experiment Standards</span>
- The sample size must be large enough to have enough opportunity to study varying cases and have higher accuracy
- The study should use a placebo if possible
- The subjects should be placed in treatment and control group at random
- Ideally, the study should be "double-blind" - people in the experiment shouldn't know whether they are in the treatment or control group and the people administering the treatment do not know this quality either
