## Box Plots
- Box Plots can give you a five-number summary of a specific dataset
- Box plots basically give you a synopsis of what the dataset "looks" like without giving too much information either
- Box Plots are like $2$-dimensional histograms as theey show the outliers and can help you compare multiple datasets
- There is a calculation to arbitrarily find which values are and are not outliers
- Whiskers of box plots determine the most extreme values that are still not classified as outliers by this arbitrary calculation
- The five numbers included in a five-numer summary
	- Minimum non-outlier value
	- Maximum non-outlier value
	- Median value ($Q2$)
	- Quartile 1 ($Q1$)
	- Quartile 3 ($Q3$)
- Dots after the maximum or before the minimum are considered outliers from the dataset

## Comparing Two Box Plots
- Using a box plot, we can compare two given datasets by simply seeing them next to each other
- A single box plot can give context to another plot, especially if they graph the same data
- You can compare each one of the number from the five-number summary to get a holistic understanding of the two datasets and how they compare

****
## Scatter Plots
- Scatter plots help visualize variability in a dataset
- Scatter plots help identify relations between two given variables
- This is not looking at cause and effect, but just association
- Association: as one value increases or decreases, what do we expect will happen to the other value that we are measuring?
- The main idea of scatter plots is trying to notice trends in the dataset
- Sometimes, the pattern that we find may be linear and may work quite well with incremented values, but in other cases, the pattern may be different, oftentimes including bell curves

****
## Correlation Coefficient
- The correlation coefficient is found by graphing the best-fit line
- The correlation coefficient is on a scale between $0$ and $1$, or in other words, $c \in [0,1]$
- A correlation coefficient of $1$ signifies the data follows a strictly linear pattern
- A correlation coefficient of $0$ signifiees that the data has no particular linear pattern
- In essence, the correlation coefficient tells us how close the best fit line is to being a perfectly straight line

## Nuances
- When a problem asks to describe the relationship or trend that is shown in a particular graph or dataset, you should include the trend (positive/negative), the shape (linear/nonlinear), and the strength (how spread out the data is)
- The strength refers to the strength of the pattern or relation that is being referred to
- In certain cases, there appears to be no trend, in which case, the correlation coefficient will be $0$
